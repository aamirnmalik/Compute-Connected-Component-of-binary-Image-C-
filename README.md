# Compute-Connected-Component-of-binary-Image-C-
This program computes connected components for a binary image. 
The program takes a binary image as input and then zero frames it. 
It then goes trough three passes to compute the connected components each followed by a pretty print 
of the image along with the label array. 
The output file will have the image after pass1, then pass 2 and finally pass 3 which is the connected component image.  
To run the program provide an input file as argument 1 and output file as argument 2. 
The class Image Processing also allows you to take advantage of other functions like mirror framing the binary image 
to computing histograms.
